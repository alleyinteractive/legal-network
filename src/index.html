  <h1>About the Fund</h1>
  <p>The Legal Clinics Fund is a collaborative fund to support the growth and sustainability of legal clinics across the United States that seek to advance and defend first amendment rights, media freedom, and transparency in their communities and nationally. The Fund will provide grants to support the clinics’ growth, collaboration, capacity building, and experimentation. The hope is that this Fund will be a catalyst for the growth and sustainability of existing clinics and centers and will provide newsrooms and journalists with increased legal resources and representation for those who are least likely to receive it from traditional sources. Ultimately, the Fund seeks to ensure that any newsroom or journalists who needs legal support can access it.</p>

  <p>The Fund is supported by Democracy Fund, Heising-Simons Foundation, and The Klarman Family Foundation. The Miami Foundation serves as fiscal sponsor for the Fund.</p>

  <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
  <p>The Fund will provide financial support primarily to First Amendment and media serving legal clinics affiliated with accredited law schools. The Fund will administer grants in three broad areas: capacity building and infrastructure, collaboration, and experimentation.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Capacity building and infrastructure: The Fund seeks to invest in capacity building efforts including, but not limited to, the funding of fellows, litigation costs, administrative support, programmatic support and/or expansion, etc. that will enable legal clinics to serve more journalists and expand their impact.</li>
    <li>Collaboration and resource sharing:  The Fund seeks to support partnerships between two or more clinics tackling joint projects, cases, or tasks that leverage the diverse skills or scale of the network as well as projects that create shared resources that make clinics more efficient or impactful.</li>
    <li>Experimentation: The fund wants to support forward looking, exploratory and experimental projects that could have profound impact on the field, or establish important new ideas.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please expect the application to open in May, 2019. More details are forthcoming. Feel free to email any questions you have to Estizer Smith, esmith@democracyfund.org</p>
